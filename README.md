# Struggle

This is simple app wehre we use fetch to get data from openweathermap api.
Than the data what we fetched is dispalyed on HTML in the form of cards like Location,Coordinates,Weather,Temperature,Visibility,Wind etc.
Only one icon which directly from API where I getting data from to be shown on the web page.
We can start this by opening 'main.html' file when scrit.js and style.css in same folder.
